# **Product Requirements Document: The Tech Tree**

## **1\. Overview**

**Product Name**: **The Tech Tree**

**Description**: The Tech Tree is an adaptive learning platform designed for quick, bite-sized educational interactions, enabling professional users to rapidly acquire valuable skills. Users bookmark knowledge areas, revisit topics, and explore new technology fields in small, engaging units, powered by an AI-driven conversational learning experience.

### **1.1 Motivation and Background**

In a rapidly changing technological landscape, professionals need continuous learning but often lack time and patience for lengthy traditional courses. Current learning platforms often emphasize rote memorization, leading to superficial understanding. The Tech Tree prioritizes active learning, engagement, and retention through interactive, stateful lessons.

### **1.2 Existing Solutions**

*   Khan Academy, Coursera, Udacity, Master's programs: structured but demanding significant time.
*   The Tech Tree differentiates by providing bite-sized, adaptive, interactive lessons orchestrated by AI, focusing on real learning effectiveness and retention through active participation and conversation.

### **1.3 Scope**

*   Initial focus: STEM, specifically AI technologies
*   Future scope: Expand to broader professional and personal topics

### **1.4 Path to Production & AI Orchestration**

The current implementation utilizes cloud-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) orchestrated via **LangGraph**, a Python library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. Specific LangGraph graphs manage the user onboarding, syllabus generation, and lesson interaction flows.

*   **Note on Portability:** LangGraph is currently specific to Python and TypeScript. If the application is rebuilt in other languages (e.g., Go, Elixir), alternative graph-based state management libraries or custom solutions suitable for those ecosystems will need to be identified or developed. Future phases might still involve exploring locally hosted or fine-tuned models, integrated within the chosen orchestration framework.

### **4.3 Lessons**

*   Each lesson is an interactive, conversational experience managed by the Lesson LangGraph.
*   The flow typically involves:
    *   Initial exposition or prompt from the AI.
    *   User interaction (asking questions, requesting exercises, submitting answers).
    *   Intent classification by the LangGraph to determine the next step.
    *   Dynamic generation of chat responses, exercises, or assessments by specific LangGraph nodes.
    *   Evaluation of user answers with adaptive feedback.
*   Lesson state (`lesson_state_json`) and conversation history (`conversation_history`) are stored in the `user_progress` and `conversation_history` tables (SQLite) respectively, allowing users to resume lessons and enabling the AI to maintain context.
*   The syllabus might be dynamically modified based on performance during lessons (future goal, requires LangGraph logic).

### **4.4 Bookmarking and Returning**

*   Lesson progress and state are automatically saved in the database (`user_progress` table), allowing users to resume.
*   Manual bookmarking/favorites could be added as a feature.

### **4.5 Adaptive Difficulty**

*   The Lesson LangGraph manages adaptive difficulty by:
    *   Evaluating user responses to exercises/assessments.
    *   Adjusting subsequent questions or explanations based on the stored lesson state and performance.
    *   Potentially prompting users to revisit foundational topics if needed.

### **4.6 Progress Tracking / Gamification**

*   Visual progress bars (calculated from `user_progress` data), badges, milestones (Bronze, Silver, Gold mastery).
*   Leaderboards for motivation.

### **4.7 Enterprise Use Cases**

*   Manager-defined syllabus, uploaded internal materials (tools, market data) - *Requires implementation*.
*   Enterprise dashboards for progress tracking - *Requires implementation*.

### **4.8 Defining New Topics**

## **6\. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **6.1 Performance**

*   Initial response time under 3 seconds for UI elements; provide streaming updates or loading indicators for slower LLM queries via LangGraph.
*   Concurrency: Initial 10 users, scaling target TBD based on SQLite performance under load.

### **6.2 Reliability**

*   99.9% uptime target for frontend/backend services.
*   Graceful fallback mechanisms within LangGraph nodes for LLM API outages or errors.

### **6.3 Security and Privacy**

*   Encryption at rest (SQLite TDE if enabled/needed) and transit (HTTPS). GDPR/CCPA compliant.
*   Minimize personal data transfer to LLM APIs; use anonymized IDs where possible.
*   Secure authentication (e.g., password hashing, JWTs).

### **6.4 Scalability**

*   **Database:** Uses SQLite. While suitable for initial phases and single-server deployments, high concurrency can become a bottleneck. WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode is enabled for better read/write concurrency. Scaling may eventually require migration to a client-server database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
*   **Backend (FastAPI):** Can be scaled horizontally behind a load balancer if needed.
*   **Frontend (Flask):** Can be scaled horizontally using a production server (e.g., Gunicorn/uWSGI) and load balancer.
*   **LangGraph/LLMs:** Scaling depends on the underlying LLM API limits and the efficiency of graph execution.

### **6.5 Maintainability**

*   Modular backend (FastAPI routers, distinct LangGraph services).
*   API-first approach between Flask frontend and FastAPI backend.
*   Automated CI/CD pipeline.
*   Code linting and formatting enforced (e.g., via pre-commit hooks).

### **6.6 Accessibility**

*   WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target for the Flask frontend templates.

### **6.7 Analytics**

*   Usage and performance monitoring (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog). Log aggregation.

## **7\. Technical Approach & Architecture**

The application follows a client-server architecture with a Python-based stack.

### **Conceptual Flow**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User (Browser)] -- HTTP --> B(Flask Frontend);
    B -- API Calls --> C(FastAPI Backend);
    C -- Uses --> D(SQLite DB Service);
    C -- Uses --> E(LangGraph Services);
    E -- Orchestrates --> F(Onboarding Graph);
    E -- Orchestrates --> G(Syllabus Graph);
    E -- Orchestrates --> H(Lesson Graph);
    F -- Calls --> I{LLM API};
    G -- Calls --> I;
    H -- Calls --> I;
    D -- Reads/Writes --> J[(SQLite DB)];
```

### **Front-End**

*   **Framework**: **Flask (Python)**
*   **Functionality**: Serves HTML templates (using Jinja2), handles user sessions, makes API calls to the backend, renders dynamic content.
*   **Styling/JS**: Standard CSS and JavaScript for interactivity.

### **Backend**

*   **Framework**: **FastAPI (Python)**
*   **Functionality**: Provides RESTful APIs for authentication, data retrieval/storage, and AI interactions. Manages core business logic.

### **AI & LLM Services**

*   **Orchestration**: **LangGraph (Python)** library is used to build and run stateful AI agents/graphs for:
    *   User Onboarding & Assessment
    *   Syllabus Generation & Retrieval
    *   Interactive Lesson Flow (chat, exercises, evaluation)
*   **LLMs**: Graphs interact with cloud-hosted LLMs (e.g., GPT models, Gemini) via API calls from within LangGraph nodes.
*   **Portability Note**: LangGraph is Python/TypeScript specific. Rebuilding in Go/Elixir would require alternative graph/state-management solutions.

### **Data Storage**

*   **Database**: **SQLite**
*   **Usage**: Stores user accounts, assessments, syllabi (modules, lessons), lesson content, user progress (including serialized lesson state), and conversation history.
*   **Access**: Managed via a dedicated service class (`SQLiteDatabaseService`) in the backend.

### **Enterprise Admin Tools**

*   *To be implemented*, likely as additional Flask/FastAPI routes and templates for syllabus creation, content upload, user management, and analytics viewing.

### **Analytics and Logging**

*   **Logging**: Centralized logging configured in the backend.
*   **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and dashboards (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog).
